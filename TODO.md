use this context inside of CreatePollForm in order to add the newly created form
CreatePollForm should close it's own modal after creation

# Forms
Login and Register forms validation
- show errors if this user already exists
- if invalid password
- or invalid email.. etc

# Design
style PollComponent buttons (vote and delete)

`navbar` responsive on desktop (change burger)
